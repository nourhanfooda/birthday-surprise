      <h2>To My Dearest Sister, Bebo 🪄</h2>
      <p>Happy 24th Birthday! 🎉</p>
      <p>Every moment we've shared in the past 24 years has been magical. You are not just my sister but my soulmate, my anchor, and my source of light in this world. You’ve been a constant source of love, support, and inspiration to me, and I honestly can’t imagine my life without you.</p>
      <p>Your laughter is the most beautiful sound, your kindness lights up the darkest days, and your determination leaves me in awe. Even though we're miles apart right now, my heart is always with you. Every day I think about how proud I am of you and how much I miss you being here by my side.</p>
      <p>This letter has been in the making for days, carefully crafted with all the love in the world because you deserve nothing less. I hope today reminds you of how truly loved and cherished you are—not just by me, but by everyone whose life you've touched.</p>
      <p>Thank you for being the sister every girl dreams of having. Thank you for being my forever friend and partner in all our crazy adventures. And most of all, thank you for being YOU.</p>
      <p>With all the love in the world, and then some more, your sister who loves you endlessly.</p>
      <p>❤ Nourhan</p>
